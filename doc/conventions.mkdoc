@section TP {Conventions}

  @section T {Coordinates system}
    Each optical element in <goptical/core lives in its own coordinates
    system. It's usually located at @em{(0, 0, 0)} with the @em Z axis
    being the local optical axis.

  @section T {Measurement units}
    @list
      @item Lengths are expressed using millimeter unit.
      @item Wavelengths are expressed in nanometer unit in vacuum.
      @item Absolute refractive indexes are used, with 1 being the
        refractive index of vacuum.
    @end list
  @end section

  @section T {Object references}
    C++ objects are used to model optical elements, materials,
    curvatures, shapes and other kinds of object <goptical/core deals
    with. As the optical system is being built, some objects keep
    references to other objects.

    The @ref dpp::ref smart pointer class is used to manage objects in a
    convenient way. Objects can either be statically allocated or
    dynamically allocated. Both can then be passed to reference holder
    objects in the same way but only dynamically allocated objects
    will be automatically deleted when not used anymore:

    @code {<goptical/core}
  using namespace goptical;

  sys::system     sys;

  // statically allocated object added to the system
  sys::SourceRays src1(math::vector3_0);
  sys.add(src1);

  // dynamically allocated object added to the system
  ref<sys::SourceRays> src2 = ref<sys::SourceRays>::create(math::vector3_0);
  sys.add(src2);
    @end code
